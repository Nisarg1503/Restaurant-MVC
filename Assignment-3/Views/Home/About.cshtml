        <p>
            Once you step into the portals of this experience, you would have stepped into a New World; a world, which takes you back in time.<br />
            <br />At “Patang”, we not only bring alive the traditional Indian and Gujarati culture but also harp on the need to preserve the same for future generations; quite simply because we want the myriad expressions which have come to occupy the faces to last and be passed on <br />
            <br />The traditional welcome – full of warmth; the leisurely saunter in lush green surrounds along lantern lit pathways and responsible for those manifold expressions; the courtyard temple with four generation idols; the works of art and the resplendent architecture of yesteryears; and much more, is what “Patang” is all about.
